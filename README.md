This directory contains everything needed for
**Chapter 10 (Build an Index)** in
[*Computational Thinking and Problem Solving (CTPS)*](https://profsmith89.github.io/ctps/ctps.html)
by Michael D. Smith.

`rk_strmatch.py`: A Python implementation of Rabin-Karp string matching.

`simple_hash.py`: A simplified version of the hashing used in Rabin-Karp.  This
script contains both the `simple_hash` and `update_hash` functions.

`index*.py`: Scripts we use in building a book index using the Python dictionary
data type.

`JustDavid-chaps.txt`: An input for our `index32.py` script that contains only
the chapters (no preface material). The full `JustDavid.txt` file is in `chap09`.

`ale01.py`: Starter code in ALE \#1.

`ale02.py`: Starter code in ALE \#2.

`hashfun.py`: Used as a pre-class exercise to get you to think about hash
functions and how difficult it is to find a collision in one that's
well-designed.
